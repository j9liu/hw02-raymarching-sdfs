# External Resources

In addition to the class lectures and powerpoints, I consulted a few external resources for this project:
- http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/#signed-distance-functions, for a summary of the ray-marching algorithm.
- http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm, for a list of signed distance functions.

The ice scream scoops were modeled using variously transformed sphere SDFs.
